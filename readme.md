So, in an effort to broaden my horizons, I've started trying to learn a few other languages, including [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) and [Dart](https://dartlang.org).

Here are some miscellaneous code samples.

#####Running the Dart examples:

Follow the [Dart installation directions](https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/mac.html) then run code by doing `dart fizzbuzz.dart`.

#####Running the Crystal examples:

Follow the [Crystal installation directions](http://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/index.html) then `crystal fizzbuzz.cr`.
