So, in an effort to broaden my horizons, I've started trying to learn a few other languages, including [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) and [Dart](https://dartlang.org).

Here are some miscellaneous code samples.

#####Running the Dart examples:

Follow the [Dart installation directions](https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/mac.html) then run code by doing `dart fizzbuzz.dart`.

#####Running the Crystal examples:

Follow the [Crystal installation directions](http://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/index.html) then `crystal fizzbuzz.cr`.

#####Running the Rust examples:

You can run them as an executable in your terminal. For example, `./fizzbuzz` while in the Rust directory.

If you want to mess around with them and recompile the executable, follow the [Rust installation directions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/getting-started.html#installing-rust) then compile with `rustc fizzbuzz.rs`.

#####Running the Haskell examples:

Install `runhaskell` using `brew install ghc cabal-install` first, then do `runhaskell fizzbuzz.hs`.

#####Running the Erlang examples:

Install `erl` using `brew install erlang` then do `erl`. In the REPL, type `c(fizzbuzz)` to compile then `fizzbuzz:fizzbuzzer(100)`.
